# Adapters

## What is an Adapter?

TrustBloc's [Edge-Adapter](https://github.com/trustbloc/edge-adapter) acts as a go-between for
Relying Party (RP) and Issuer components to support DIDComm operations.

TrustBloc's Edge-Adapter can be used to run an Issuer and an RP.

[Get the adapter here](https://github.com/trustbloc/edge-adapter/tree/master/cmd/adapter-rest).

Here are the flags for the server:

```
Start adapter-rest inside the edge-adapter

## RP Adapter

The Relying Party (RP) Adapter enables standard OpenID Connect flows on top of DIDComm.

### Configuring the RP Adapter

The following is a snippet of a Docker Compose {superscript}`TM` file showing how [Edge Adapter](https://github.com/trustbloc/edge-adapter) can be configured for use as an RP.

```yaml
rp.adapter.rest.example.com:
  container_name: rp.adapter.rest.example.com
  image: ${RP_ADAPTER_REST_IMAGE}:latest
  environment:
    - ADAPTER_REST_HOST_URL=0.0.0.0:8070
    - ADAPTER_REST_TLS_CACERTS=/etc/tls/ec-cacert.pem
    - ADAPTER_REST_GOVERNANCE_VCS_URL=http://governance.vcs.example.com:8066
    - ADAPTER_REST_TLS_SYSTEMCERTPOOL=true

### Deploying the RP Adapter

To learn about integrating your OIDC client to a TrustBloc RP Adapter,
read our [integration guide](https://github.com/trustbloc/edge-adapter/blob/master/docs/rp/integration/relying_parties.md).

## Issuer Adapter

This component is an intermediary to act on behalf of an Issuer to perform DIDComm related use cases.

### Configuring the Issuer Adapter

The following is a snippet of a Docker Compose {superscript}`TM` file showing how [Edge Adapter](https://github.com/trustbloc/edge-adapter) can be configured for use as an issuer.

```yaml
issuer.adapter.rest.example.com:
  container_name: issuer.adapter.rest.example.com
  image: ${ISSUER_ADAPTER_REST_IMAGE}:latest
  environment:
    - ADAPTER_REST_HOST_URL=0.0.0.0:9070
    - ADAPTER_REST_GOVERNANCE_VCS_URL=http://governance.vcs.example.com:8066
    - ADAPTER_REST_TLS_CACERTS=/etc/tls/ec-cacert.pem
    - ADAPTER_REST_TLS_SYSTEMCERTPOOL=true
    - ADAPTER_REST_TLS_SERVE_CERT=/etc/tls/ec-pubCert.pem
    - ADAPTER_REST_TLS_SERVE_KEY=/etc/tls/ec-key.pem
    - ADAPTER_REST_DIDCOMM_INBOUND_HOST=0.0.0.0:9071
    - ADAPTER_REST_DIDCOMM_INBOUND_HOST_EXTERNAL=http://issuer.adapter.rest.example.com:9071
    - ADAPTER_REST_TRUSTBLOC_DOMAIN=${BLOC_DOMAIN}
    - ADAPTER_REST_UNIVERSAL_RESOLVER_URL=http://did.rest.example.com:8072/1.0/identifiers
    - ADAPTER_REST_DSN=mysql://issueradapter:issueradapter-secret-pw@tcp(mysql:3306)/
    - ADAPTER_REST_DSN_TIMEOUT=45
  ports:
    - 9070:9070
    - 9071:9071
  entrypoint: ""
  command:  /bin/sh -c "adapter-rest start"
  volumes:
    - ../keys/tls:/etc/tls
  networks:
    - bdd_net
```

See this example in full [here](https://github.com/trustbloc/edge-adapter/blob/master/test/bdd/fixtures/adapter-rest/docker-compose.yml).

## Adapter Components (CHAPI + DIDComm)

```{image} _static/adapter_component_diagram.svg
```

## Flows

### The Evidence and Driver's License (DL) Flow

These components allow users to access services with a VC such as a Driver's License.
They are:

- Issuer Adapter
- RP Adapter

### Combined DL, Evidence & Credit Score Flow

Here is an overfiew of the [Bank Account usecase](https://github.com/trustbloc/edge-sandbox/blob/master/docs/demo/new-bank-account-usecase.md).

This scenario shows how a person can open a bank account using both local and remote credentials.
A local credential is stored in a user's wallet while the remote credential is stored with a third-party.

In order to create the bank account, a Drivers License (local credential), Drivers Licence Evidence (remote credential)
and Credit Score (remote credential) are required.

These are issued as VCs from a [Drivers License Issuer](https://demo-issuer.sandbox.trustbloc.dev/drivinglicense) and
a [Credit Score Issuer](https://demo-issuer.sandbox.trustbloc.dev/creditscore).

This uses the [Adapter/DIDComm](https://github.com/trustbloc/edge-sandbox/blob/master/docs/demo/sandbox_adapter_playground.md) flow.
