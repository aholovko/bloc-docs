# Introduction

Orb implements the following specifications: [did:orb](https://trustbloc.github.io/did-method-orb/), [Activity Anchors](https://trustbloc.github.io/activityanchors/). The did:orb method is based on the [Sidetree](https://identity.foundation/sidetree/spec/) specification and Activity Anchors is based on the [ActivityPub](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/) and [ActivityStreams](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-core/) specifications. Orb uses [Google Trillian](https://github.com/google/trillian) for its ledger.
